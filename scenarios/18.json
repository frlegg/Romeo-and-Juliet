What if I ask you if you love me? What if you say yes, but you’re lying? Will you say the truth Romeo? I mean, like, how should I act? Am I, like, too silly? Or maybe too into the relationship already? I don’t know Romeo!<br>Romeo: I’ll swear by the Maccas I love to eat after school!<br>Juliet: Don’t sware by McDonalds, the food that is eaten in a second.<br>Romeo: Well what should I swear by?<br>Juliet: I dunno, don’t swear at all!

Just go, my love!<br>Romeo: What, are you going to just leave me at this?<br>Juliet: What more could you want?<br>Romeo: Honest pledges of love, duh!<br>Juliet: I already pledged my love! Even still though I would give it again if I had to. I love you infinitely Romeo!<br>Nurse calls<br>Give me a sec, Rome.<br>Juliet exits<br>Oh, far out, I’m too scared this is all a dream.
