    "text": "Romeo: Love told me! (Editor’s note: Is it really love if its from a stalker?)\nJuliet: This is like SO embarresing. My head is like swimming with thoughts. What if I ask you if you love me? What if you say yes, but you’re lying? Will you say the truth Romeo? I mean, like, how should I act? Am I, like, too silly? Or maybe too into the relationship already? I don’t know Romeo!\nRomeo: I’ll swear by the Maccas I love to eat after school!\nJuliet: Don’t sware by McDonalds, the food that is eaten in a second.\nRomeo: Well what should I swear by?\nJuliet: I dunno, don’t swear at all! Swearing’s too quick. Just go, my love!\nRomeo: What, are you going to just leave me at this?\nJuliet: What more could you want?\nRomeo: Honest pledges of love, duh!\nJuliet: I already pledged my love! Even still though I would give it again if I had to. I love you infinitely Romeo!\nNurse calls\nGive me a sec, Rome.\nJuliet exits\nOh, far out, I’m too scared this is all a dream. Its too good to be real.\nJuliet enters\nJuliet: Surely if you really love me, you’ll be my boyfriend and tell me tomorrow on Snapchat.\nNurse: Juliet!\nJuliet: Yeah, I’m coming. But if you don’t really love me Rome, then—\nNurse: Juliet, come!\nJuliet: Yeah, I’m coming, geez. —stop trying to get me and just leave me to cry in peace. I’ll send the message on Snap tomorrow.\nRomeo: My life depends on it.\nJuliet: A thousand times goodnight.\nRomeo: It is a thousand times worse to leave you. I want to stay with you forever! \nJuliet: I hate being stuck in this house. I want to come with you forever also! And hey, when will we talk on Snapchat?\nRomeo: 9am\nJuliet: I can’t wait – I’ll be waiting all night for your message!",
