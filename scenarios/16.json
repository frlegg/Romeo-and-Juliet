Do you like Romeo?\nJuliet: How did you get here? You must be good at parkour to get over our walls.\nRomeo: I got over these walls not because of my insane parkour skills (which I do have regardless) but because of my love for you. *Muttering* gosh that sounded cheesey. \nRomeo starts climbing up\nJuliet: My family will kill you if they see you. Like literally kill you. Like LITERALLY KILL YOU.\nRomeo: I care far more about you. If you hate me, that would be far more deadly than any of your family’s weapons. *Muttering* gosh, that was really cheesey\nJuliet: I’d give the world to make sure they do not see you here.\nRomeo: Don’t worry about it. All I care about is if you love me.\nJuliet: Who told you where my bedroom was? Little creepy, eh?",
